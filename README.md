# CSharp_Projects

  The FoodBillCalculator project is a C# application that calculates the amount of money each person in a party owes toward a shared meal or other expense. It supports numerical entry and has error-handling for user entries that are not numbers. Resulting values are formatted as US dollar amounts.

  The Guessing Game Project is a customizable guessing game that randomly generates a "correct" answer based on a few basic user-defined parameters. User specifies the range (negative numbers not supported as of yet) between which the value of the correct answer must fall, and the number the correct answer must be a multiple of.
  Application has error handling for non-numerical inputs as well as numerical values that fall outside of the ranges previously specified by the user.
